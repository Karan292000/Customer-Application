This is a MERN(MongoDb,Expressjs,Reactjs,Nodejs) stack web appliaction for manage customers data.
	I used mongodb for database and also implemented mongoose pacakage for database validation.
	For server i used Nodejs.In this app i included rest api like get,put,post,update,delete....
	And also i have done some authentication and authorization for admin to manage customers data.Â 
	For UI i used Reactjs, in this frontend i have implemented modals,list and form manipulate customers data.
	I have used local storage for admin persistent login.
